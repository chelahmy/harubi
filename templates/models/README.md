Models
======

A **model** is an abstract software definition denoting user needs. A model definition should be clear to both users and developers. Users **act** on models. In harubi, a model is *vertically* sliced into unique implementable actions. The word vertical is also an abstract definition. We will discuss vertical and horizontal slices shortly. An **action** is implemented as a **controller** which is a software code serving a user's action. A controller may process inputs, persist data, trigger external systems, or do anything in the realm of software. A controller responds to a user request through an action.
