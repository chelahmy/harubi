Harubi Templates
================

Harubi templates serve as the starting points for building harubi applications. However, the listed templates are not the only ways to build harubi applications. The templates highlight harubi approaches.

New templates will be added from time to time.

Harubi emphasizes on **model-driven development**. In fact, harubi makes it difficult to do otherwise. Harubi introduces necessary constraints so that every harubi developer will have the same good skills and approaches. Harubi codes will be consistent. Hence, harubi collaboration will be made easier.

Every software application can be formed as a collection of models. Users ***act*** on models. Hence, the **model-action** pattern is both user and developer friendly. See [Model-Action Framework](models)
